# 🚗 Car Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the selling price of cars based on various features such as fuel type, car body, engine size, horsepower, mileage, and more. It uses machine learning regression techniques to find insights and predict prices accurately.

## ✅ Features

• Data cleaning and preprocessing  
• Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
• Encoding categorical variables  
• Train-test split  
• Linear Regression Model  
• Model performance evaluation using R² score  
• Visualization of model results  

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used is **Car Price** dataset containing specifications and features of different cars.

Some important columns include:

- CarName
- fueltype
- aspiration
- carbody
- drivewheel
- wheelbase
- carlength
- carwidth
- carheight
- curbweight
- enginetype
- cylindernumber
- enginesize
- horsepower
- peakrpm
- highwaympg
- price (Target)


## 🔍 Visualizations

We plotted the following:

- Actual vs Predicted prices scatter plot   

These help understand patterns and relationships within data.
